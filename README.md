1. Problem-statement
      Build an web-app about yoga courses which make the affordable contents to all kinds of auidences can get knowledge from it especially the youth of our contry tries to get re-connected to our health from that the youth of our country. And also they get the knowledge of various wisdoms that are teahced by our rishi-munis (ancestors).  



2. Description
    We know that the health is very essential part of our life so we can't ignore it , and our country is the very powerful source of physical fitness our ancestors introduce the concept yoga to us. Nowadays the yoga becomes very popular in foreign countries we should be proud of it. But our countries youth is somewhat ignoring their health so to aware the youth's of our country we are trying to build an web-application that give them an amount of knowledge from that they will re-connect to themselves.


3. Why web-app ?
    When we want to finalize our project we had lots of discussion about how we can done our project by the 42 days of given-time we take 4 days out of 42 days to analyze will the android app is able to fullfill the requirements the we want to give our users ?. But on third day we have a meeting and we finalize the web-app is easily accessable by anyone and we have to build such a web-app that can be suitable for any kind of audience such as mothers, childrens and youth people.
    

4. Features 
    There are four kinds of service that we want to give to our users the features are 
    a. Yoga courses
    b. Mediation session
    c. Wisdoms knowledge
    d. Music session -- (in development)
    
    Also there is one special session we want to give our users is that when he/she wants to analyze the yoga-pose done by him/her then how it is correct, analyzed by the Machine learning module which is in under-development. The first phase of any pose-detection is completed by us the pose-estimation (Getting the keypoints from our real movements of our body then show the keypoints to the users by using camera) .This fifth feature is the very core of this project.
   
   
6. Functions
    To access the contents you must have to login it , the feature of the login and logout is done by PHP backend this is the entry point of our web-app second one is appeared when you open a home page when you log-in the courses we have uploaded is also a creativity of the backend because when an admin is using the function 'add-courses' then he can add the specific course in the yoga courses. We have introduce the seven courses they are as follows.
    1. yoga for adults
    2. Yoga for weight loss
    3. Postnatal yoga
    4. Prenatal yoga
    5. Breath work
    6. Daily yoga


7. Future Scope 
   When we talk about future scope of this app then it is we feel very proud for being an Indian that we are born in the best nation in the world. The best and biggest gift that india gave to the world is mathematics , science , philosophy , agriculture , martial-arts , geometry , ink..... and so on but the powerful and healthy gift that our country gave is YOGA. The future scope of this web-app is when you found yourself connectionless with your-self the try out our web-app there so much in it from that you can connect you and as well as to 'ATMAYOG'.
